# QuickMap
**Description:** Make interactive, lightweight HTML maps using leaflet to share geospatial data. Currently, this map is used to visualize USGS gauges, HUCs, and stream flowlines for specific study domain.

**Input data:** Three shapefiles for USGS gauges, HUCs, and stream flowlines with the same spatial projection.

**Output data:** 
1. HTML file for the created map. 
2. Jupyter notebook created specifically for the desired study domain to regenerate and/or modify the map if needed. 

**Example for a created map:**
